# 🌱 EcoTrack – AI-Powered Personal Carbon Footprint Tracker
## 🧠 My Idea in a Nutshell
EcoTrack is a mobile application that uses artificial intelligence to analyze daily user activities — such as transportation, diet, shopping, and energy use — and delivers personalized, actionable recommendations to help reduce their carbon footprint in real time.

---

## 📚 Background  
### Problem  
Individual carbon emissions significantly contribute to climate change, yet accessible and personalized tools to understand and reduce one’s environmental impact are scarce.

### Frequency  
This is a daily issue affecting billions of people worldwide, as routine choices in travel, food, and consumption directly influence CO₂ emissions.

### Personal Motivation  
As someone passionate about sustainability, I wanted to build a solution that empowers individuals with data-driven insights, making eco-friendly living simple and measurable.

### Importance  
When small, informed changes are adopted widely, they can collectively lead to substantial reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions.

## 📊 Data and AI Techniques  
### Data Sources  
- **User inputs**: Transportation logs, grocery receipts, utility bills.
- **Public datasets**: EPA emission factors, product lifecycle databases (e.g., Agri-Footprint, EXIOBASE).
- **IoT/smart devices**: Energy meter data, wearable activity trackers (with explicit user consent).

### AI/ML Techniques  
- **Regression models** to estimate CO₂ emissions from activity data.
- **Recommendation engines** to suggest sustainable alternatives (e.g., biking routes, low-carbon products).
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** for scanning receipt text or product descriptions.
- **Time-series analysis** for tracking trends and predicting future footprint.

### Demo Implementation  
A lightweight Flask web app using the UK Government GHG conversion factors dataset.  
- Predicts carbon footprint from transport mode and distance.

## 👥 How It Is Used  
### Context  
Used daily by environmentally conscious individuals, families, schools, and corporate sustainability programs.

### Users  
- General public seeking to live more sustainably.  
- Sustainability officers in organizations.  
- Educators and students in environmental science programs.

### Impact  
- **Users** gain awareness and agency over their environmental impact.  
- **Communities** benefit from aggregated anonymized insights (e.g., heat maps of emission hotspots).  
- **Policymakers** can access anonymized trend data to support green urban planning.

---

## ⚠️ Challenges  
- **Data Privacy**: Personal consumption data is sensitive; strict anonymization and encryption protocols are required.
- **Estimation Accuracy**: Not all products/activities have precise emission factors — estimates carry inherent uncertainty.
- **Behavioral Adoption**: Recommendations do not guarantee user action; motivational design is crucial.
- **Accessibility & Equity**: Assumes smartphone access and availability of sustainable alternatives.

---

## 🚀 What Next  
### Future Development  
- **API integrations** with smart home devices, EV charging networks, and e-commerce platforms.  
- **Gamification**: Challenges, badges, and social sharing to boost engagement.  
- **B2B Expansion**: Corporate dashboard for tracking employee carbon footprints.  
- **Research Collaboration**: Partner with environmental NGOs to refine emission models.
